## Technologies Used

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Backend: PHP

Database: MySQL

Face Recognition: Face-api.js (based on TensorFlow.js)

Server: XAMPP (Apache + MySQL)

Export: Excel (CSV/XLS)



Project Implementation Methodology
1️⃣ Face Data Collection

Admin registers students.

System captures 5 or more facial images per student.

Images are stored in the labels/ folder and linked to student records.

2️⃣ Face Detection

Webcam captures live video.

Face-api.js detects faces using deep learning models.

Facial landmarks and descriptors are extracted.

3️⃣ Face Recognition

Extracted facial features are compared with stored face descriptors.

Euclidean distance is used to match the closest face.

If matched, student identity is confirmed.

4️⃣ Attendance Recording

Recognized student ID is saved into the database with:

Date

Time

Course

Unit

Venue

5️⃣ Report Generation

Lecturer can export attendance records to Excel for documentation.
